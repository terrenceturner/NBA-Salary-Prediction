# NBA-Salary-Prediction

Whether you're Sam Presti, Danny Ainge, or Rob Pelinka, your job as general manager (GM) in the NBA to form the best team 
possible to help win the organization a championship. But the one problem all GM's face is how much is too much for a player. 
Of course, there are superstar players that deserve Max contracts and players on the decline that deserve the veteran minimum, 
but what about those in between. Maybe a player that shows promise but may not be a star yet. How would you pay him?

This project aims at assisting NBA general managers in choosing how much to pay a player by:
- Performing statistical data analysis
- Developing machine learning model using RandomForestRegressor and GridSearchCV

This repository contains datasets collected from Kaggle and basketball reference websites that include 2015-19 seasons NBA 
players stats and 2019-20 season NBA players stats. Also included are NBA players' contracts from spotrac website. 
The repository also provides data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning models for RandomForestRegressor 
and GridSearchCV.
